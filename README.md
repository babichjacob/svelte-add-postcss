<h1 align="center">🔺 Add PostCSS to Svelte</h1>

## ❓ What is this?
This is an **experimental** command to run to add PostCSS to your SvelteKit project.

## 🛠 Usage
You must start with a fresh copy of the official SvelteKit template, which is currently created by running this command:
```sh
npm init svelte@next
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up PostCSS:
```sh
npx apply svelte-add/postcss # --no-ssh
```

After the preset runs,
* You can write PostCSS syntax in the `style` blocks in Svelte files.

* You can write PostCSS syntax in the `src/global.css` file.
  
  This is your global stylesheet because it will be active on every page of your site.

* All your CSS will be minified for production with CSSNano.

* You can install more [PostCSS plugins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/main/docs/plugins.md) and configure them in the `postcss.config.cjs` file.

* You can apply *another* [Svelte Adder](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-adders) to your project for more functionality. Specifically, check out [svelte-add/tailwindcss](https://github.com/svelte-add/tailwindcss).
