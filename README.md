<h1 align="center">🔺 Add PostCSS to Svelte</h1>

## ❓ What is this?
This is an **experimental** command to run to add PostCSS to your SvelteKit project.

## 🛠 Usage
You must start with a fresh copy of the official SvelteKit template, which is currently created by running this command:
```sh
npm init svelte@next
# By the way, please listen to its warnings that SvelteKit is an alpha project
# https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit#When_can_I_start_using_it
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up PostCSS:
```sh
npx use-preset babichjacob/svelte-add-postcss --no-ssh
```

Then ensure your dependencies are up to date:
```sh
pnpm update  # If you don't have pnpm, just get it already (and I don't know the npm equivalent of this command)
```

After the preset runs,
* You can write PostCSS syntax in the `style` blocks in Svelte files.

* You can write PostCSS syntax in the `src/routes/_global.pcss` file.
  
  This is your global stylesheet because it will be active on every page of your site.

* All your CSS will be minified for production with CSSNano.

* You can apply *another* [Svelte Adder](https://github.com/babichjacob/svelte-adders) to your project for more functionality. Specifically, check out [svelte-add-tailwindcss](https://github.com/babichjacob/svelte-add-tailwindcss).
